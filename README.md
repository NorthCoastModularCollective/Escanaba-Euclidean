# EuclideanTrigger
A simple module, based on the ATtiny85 that creates euclidean beats from a clock input. [under development]

# Build instructions

[TODO]


# How To Setup Firmware

1. In the Arduino editor, in the tools menu, set the board to "AtTiny25/45/85"
1. set Processor to "AtTiny85"
1. set Clock to "Internal 8Mhz"
1. plug your programmer into a usb port. We reccomend the (TinyAvr programmer)[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11801] from sparkfun
1. select your programmer in the tools menu
1. in tools, select burn bootloader. Your AtTiny is now configured to run at 8Mhz.
1. now hit the upload button in the arduino editor to flash the firmware.
1. place the chip into the mount on the back of the module. Take care to make sure the dot on the back of the chip aligns with the indent on the PCB board diagram.
1. plug the module into your rack and have fun!
